Recursion
1. Recursion is when a function calls itself, sometimes repeatedly. 
2. You need a base case to identify when the recursion stops. If there is no base
case, recursive functions can't begin the process of returning a final value. 

Graphs
1. A graph is a data structure that represents relationships in a set of data. 
2. A graphs nodes can have multiple adjacencies, and unlike trees, graphs may
or may not be directed. Trees have hierarchies, and graphs do not. 
3. A graph would be a good model for modeling friendships and connections between people. 

Performances of Different Data Structures



Sorting
1. Bubble sort works by comparing the first two items in a list to see which one is greater. 
The greater number gets placed on the right. Then the greater number gets compared to 
the next item, and so on, until the last number is the greatest. The biggest number 
bubbles to the top. 
2. Merge sort works by ordering two lists separately, then checking the first item in the
first list and comparing it to
